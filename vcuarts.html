	<p>VCUarts Communications is an office that provides PR, marketing, and design services in-house to the VCUarts dean’s office and academic departments.</p> 
	<p>For the past year, Communications has been reshaping VCUarts’ presence, which is undergoing both a print and digital rebrand. I mainly collaborate with clients, designers, and developers on digital operations—especially in terms of redefining how VCUarts’ websites should look, feel, and function.</p>

 <p>A site I’m currently working on redesigning and streamlining is the <a href="http://arts.vcu.edu/calendar/events/" target="_blank">VCUarts Calendar</a>. This is a mockup of my most recent progress and direction:</p>

	</ul>

	 <p>I've been working to improve consistency and navigability on our websites. A  challenge we've encountered is how we should redefine our navigation for future themes, and how to avoid redundancy and confusion when we need to adhere to both the university and the school's brand standards. To make the site's multiple components more accessible to users, and allow them to search with more specificity and ease, we've combined monthly and daily views onto one page, the homepage, and pared down our filtering options to the most essential search categories and options.</p>
	<p>When I joined VCUarts Communications in May 2016, the rebrand (led by Emily Park) was already underway but mainly focused on the print side of things. I transposed those ideas for web. Emily and I both agreed that a change of typeface from the rounded Karla to the lean (and modernist) Aktiv Grotesk would help with giving VCUarts a more grown-up look.</p>
 	<p>Overall, we thought that the VCUarts brand should be more elevated to reflect our rankings (as the #1 public art school in the nation, and second overall), but also retain a bit of spice (at the end of the day, we are an art school after all).</p>

		<p>A smaller part of my job also includes creating print and digital assets, like animations and illustrations for social media and email campaigns:</p>

	<p>I created the concept, design, and illustrations for a poster mailed to prospective students regarding National Portfolio Day.</p>
